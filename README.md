# Work Sample: Mariners 2025 Analytics Intern Problem Set

This project was completed as part of the application process for the 2025 Mariners Analytics Internship. I am hosting it here as a work sample to display my skills in data analytics, data visualization, and machine learning.

See the word document in the project directory for a description of the problems attempted. My write-up is located at `paper/latex/main.pdf`.

Due to file size restrictions, the data files used are not included in the GitHub repository.
